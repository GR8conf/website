            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
            <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help
            ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
            <p><b><i>tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk</i></b></p>
            <h2>Reporting violations</h2>
            <p>We take our code of conduct seriously! Please report any potential violations to a conference organizer in person or send an email to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:shaun@prettygoodconferences.org">shaun@prettygoodconferences.org</a>. All complaints will
            be investigated immediately. If the person reporting the incident wishes, the organizers will provide updates how how the complaint is being dealt with.</p>
            <h2>Questions about the policy</h2>
            <p>Please send all questions, comments and concerns to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:shaun@prettygoodconferences.org">shaun@prettygoodconferences.org</a>.</p>
            <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
            <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
            participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
            expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
            <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Harassment</h3>
                <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography
                or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
                <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes,
                or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
                <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
                <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>
                <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your
                attendance.</p>
                <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
                <h3>Alcohol</h3>
                <p> Alcohol use is prohibited at all conference activities except those explicitly designated by conference staff (e.g. happy hours). Attendees, organizers, speakers and sponsors who wish to consume alcohol during designated conference activities
                or off site are welcome to do so, but are expected to do so responsibly. Anyone abusing alcohol either by over consumption or consuming alcohol in non-approved areas of the conference may be asked to leave the conference without refund
                at the organizer's discretion.</p>
                <h3>Speaker code of conduct</h3>
                <p> We value the variety of opinions and knowledge offered by our speakers. We do not want to infringe on their ability to provide valuable knowledge and perspective to attendees. However, we feel that some content is not valuable to our attendees
                and detracts from our conferences as a whole.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anything that violates the above harassment policy. The obvious reasons for which are stated above.</li>
                    <li>Excessive profanity. We're all adults and can handle the occasional curse word, but if a speaker is going out of their way to use this type of language to shock or in general change the tone of the conference, we feel it is not valuable
                    to our attendees.</li>
                    <li>Non-related content. Our conferences are not commercials. We expect there to be technical value in a talk, not a pitch for a product. This can occasionally be a fine line, which will be determined at the discretion of the organizers.</li>
                    <li>Negativity towards other speakers or the conference as a whole. We feel that as speakers, you are representing our conference. That includes all others who have taken the time to prepare and present. Putting down someone else's work
                    is not conducive to a good conference environment. Polite disagreement is of course OK, but genuine hostility towards another speaker will not be tolerated.</li>
